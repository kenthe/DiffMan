% The DiffMan examples are:
%
% dmex1   -           This is an ODE evolving in SO(3) 
%
% dmex1a  -           This is an ODE evolving in SO(3)
%            PURPOSE: Integrate 'dmex1' with variable and constant stepsize
%                     for timesteppers: 'tscg' and 'tsrk'.     
%
% dmex2   -           Solution of the Lorenz equations in R^3 
%
% dmex3   -           This is a linear ODE evolving in SO(3) 
%
% dmex4   -           Integration of the rigid body
%
% dmex5   -           This is an ODE evolving on the sphere S^2
%
% dmex6   -           Integration of an isospectral flow
%
% dmex7   -           Integration of the Airy equation
%
% dmex8   -           Integration of the van der Pol equation
%
% dmex9   -           Integration of the heavy top
%
% dmex10  -           This is an ODE evolving in SO(3)
%
% dmex10a -           This is an ODE evolving in SO(3)
%            PURPOSE: Use "ftorder" to verify the order of the solution
%                     of some fer schemes
%            WARNING: This routine is very time consuming to run.
